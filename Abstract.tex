Suspicious Bangla text detection is a text classification problem of classifying Bangla text into suspicious and non suspicious category. To implement this project we use different statistical machine learning algorithm. To the very best of our knowledge, it is very first project of detecting suspicious Bangla text so we have to develop a corpus of suspicious Bangla text. In this project we have shown a comparison of accuracy of different machine learning algorithm which will be helpful to others. The experimental result shows maximum accuracy of 92\% for Logistic Regression using 527 training documents and 173 testing documents. The accuracy of the system can be increased by increasing the size of the dataset.
