The suspicious text detection system implementation consist of different modules. In this chapter we will see the implementation details of this modules. Finally we will see sample input and output of our system.

\section{System Requirements}
Our system takes Bengali text as input and classifies it as suspicious or non-suspicious. To implement this system some hardware and software tools are needed. Required hardware and software tools are listed below.
\subsection{Hardware Requirements}
From input to output the system propagate the following hardware :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Nvidia GeForce GTX 1070 GPU
    \item Minimum GPU RAM 8GB
    \item Physical memory 32GB
    \item Intel core i7-7700K CPU
    \item Solid State Drive (SSD) 256GB
    \item Minimum 2h backup UPS
    \item GPU cooler
    \item Monitors
\end{itemize}
\clearpage
\subsection{Software Requirements}
We implement our system in a specific software environment. Required software lists are,

\begin{itemize}
    \item Operating System : ubuntu 16.04, windows 10
    \item Python 3.0
    \item tensorflow-gpu==1.3.0
    \item djangorestframework==3.7.7
    \item numpy==1.12.1
    \item Django==1.11
    \item Pygments==2.2.0
    \item Markdown==2.6.10
    \item coreapi==2.3.3
    \item psycopg2==2.7.3.2
    \item dj-database-url==0.4.2
    \item gunicorn==19.7.1
    \item whitenoise==3.3.1
    \item django-filter==1.1.0
    \item drf-extensions==0.3.0
    \item spyder 3.6
    \item jupyter notebook
\end{itemize}
\par

All of this software are not required at a time. To implement different part of our system this softwares were used. To test our system one just need an IDE where the system could be run.

\section{Implementation Details}
We implement the system at different steps from training to testing. These steps are,
\subsection{Training Corpus}
Training corpus is key to suspicious text detection system. No pre-build corpus is available for suspicious Bangla text. We build the corpus and it takes six months to collect data form different offline sources. Our training corpus is divided into two folder one is for suspicious and another is for non suspicious. \textbf{Fig.}\ref{fig:CAP} categorical folder of our system.

    \caption{Sample Training Texts}
    \label{fig:SMT}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Stopword List}
In our system the words which has no contribution to classify text is referred as stopwords. From our training text such stopwords were removed. 635 stopwords were collected, from which a list of stopword was built. Removal of this unnecessary words helps to increase efficiency of our system.
\textbf{Fig.}\ref{fig:stpw} shows a list of some stopword.

\end{figure}
\par\noindent

\textbf{Fig.}\ref{fig:lstpw} shows the list of stopwords after loading them into our system environment.

    \label{fig:lstpw}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Processed Corpus}
Processed corpus is the list of all processed text from which we are ready to extract feature. A processed corpus can be created by following steps,
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tokenization of a text.
    \item Punctuation and stopword removal.
    \item Append back remaining words in the text.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Fig.}\ref{fig:tkn} shows tokenization of a text.
